## Sparse Self-Expressive Decomposition (SEED) Method

### 1. Setup
- Download and install OMPBox from Rob Rubinstein:
  http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/Software/ompbox10.zip

- Install oASIS solver:
  https://github.com/nerdslab/oasis

- Add all folders in oASIS, OMPbox, and SEED to your path

### 2. To get started
- To run SEED on a synthetic dataset consisting of a union of subspaces, run uos_demo.m
- To run SEED on a real dataset consisting of a collection of face images under different illumination conditions, run face_demo.m (This face data is taken from a subset of the YaleB face database, http://vision.ucsd.edu/~leekc/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html)
